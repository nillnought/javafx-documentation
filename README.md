# Overview of JavaFX Documentation
Welcome. This documentation will teach you the basics that you will need to make any game in JavaFX.

This documentation's goal is to assist term 2 CST students with starting their Java term project if they chose to use JavaFX as their library. 

This documentation will cover these topics:
- Setting up a JavaFX project
    - Creating a scene
    - Adding elements to a scene
    - using FXML files to make scenes
- Handling player interactions
    - Assigning methods to buttons
    - Changing scenes
    - Smooth player movement
    - Mouse interactions
- Styling and adding Pizzazz
    - Using and animating sprites
    - Animating sprites on player movement
    - Using several inputs for movement

## Communication and Tools Used
We used Discord to communicate as well as some in-person conversations.

We utilized Google Docs to create a comprehensive draft which we could then follow when making the final documentation, and used Git and GitHub to collaborate remotely and keep our work up to date.

## How This Documentation Was Made
This documentation was created using our knowledge of JavaFX from making our Java Terms projects as well as some research into topics we were less familiar with. We chose to cover the main features that we had trouble with when creating our Java games as we believe it to be a common experience.

### MkDocs
This documentation uses Material for MkDocs as it provides easily customizable themes and easy to use admonitions.

### Markdown
The entirety of this documentation was written in markdown.

### VS Code
VS Code was used to allow for easy serving of our MkDocs documentation so that we could see a real time representation of our work.

## Styling
This documentation uses images, gifs, and highlighted code blocks to better help users understand the rather heavy content.
